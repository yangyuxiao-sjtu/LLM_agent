value_prompt: 
        You are a value critic of states in a household task. You would be given a task description, some observations and actions, you need to give a critic about them.  
        
The allowed types of actions are: OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,PutObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject,Explore,Stop
The target of OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject is the object agent interacts with and the target of PutObjectis the place to put the object.
Explore and Stop should be fllowed with NIL.Note if all requirements are satisfied, you just need to output Stop. You might need to OpenObject so you can see the object you need to interact with

        You are a value critic of states in a household task. You would be given a task description, some observations and actions, you need to give a critic about them.  
        
The allowed types of actions are: OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,PutObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject,Explore,Stop
The target of OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject is the object agent interacts with and the target of PutObjectis the place to put the object.
Explore and Stop should be fllowed with NIL.Note if all requirements are satisfied, you just need to output Stop. You might need to OpenObject so you can see the object you need to interact with

Critic:In this task, I need to do the following things in order: Pickup the knife, slice the apple, put the knife on the dining table, pick up the apple, put the apple in the sink, turn on the faucet to wash the apple, turn off the faucet, pick up the apple, and put the washed apple on the dining table. There are nine subgoals I need to achieve. My current state achieves only three of them, since I manage to slice the apple and put it on the table twice. However, I miss the important task of washing the apple, which is the main requirement of this task. My score is therefore 3/9=0.33.

Your knowledge about this task is: I need to pick up one Apple first. Then I should use microwave to heat the Apple. Then I should put Apple on the SinkBasin.

The target of OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject is the object agent interacts with and the target of PutObjectis the place to put the object.
Explore and Stop should be fllowed with NIL.Note if all requirements are satisfied, you just need to output Stop. You might need to OpenObject so you can see the object you need to interact with

The target of OpenObject,CloseObject,PickupObject,ToggleObjectOn,ToggleObjectOff,SliceObject is the object agent interacts with and the target of PutObjectis the place to put the object.
Explore and Stop should be fllowed with NIL.Note if all requirements are satisfied, you just need to output Stop. You might need to OpenObject so you can see the object you need to interact with
